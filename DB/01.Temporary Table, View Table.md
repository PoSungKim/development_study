## Temporary Table 
> You can use the TEMPORARY keyword when creating a table. A TEMPORARY table is visible only within the current session, and is dropped automatically when the session is closed. This means that two different sessions can use the same temporary table name without conflicting with each other or with an existing non-TEMPORARY table of the same name. (The existing table is hidden until the temporary table is dropped.) - https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/create-temporary-table.html

### 특징
* Global Session 테이블과 Local Session 테이블로 정의 가능
* 영속성 테이블, CREATE 이후에 INSERT/UPDATE 필요

## View Table
> The CREATE VIEW statement creates a new view, or replaces an existing view if the OR REPLACE clause is given. If the view does not exist, CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW is the same as CREATE VIEW. If the view does exist, CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW replaces it. - https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/create-view.html

> A virtual table in SQL that functions similarly to a standard table, but does not need to be physically stored, i.e. it is only stored in memory and does not take up actual storage space.

### 특징
* 일회성 테이블, CREATE AS SELECT 이후 INSERT/UPDATE 불가능
* In-memory
* Security
* Views can simplify supporting legacy code
  * If you need to refactor a table that would break a lot of code, you can replace the table with a view of the same name. The view provides the exact same schema as the original table, while the actual schema has changed. This keeps the legacy code that references the table from breaking, allowing you to change the legacy code at your leisure.
