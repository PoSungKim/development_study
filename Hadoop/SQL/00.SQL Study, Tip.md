### [Column Alias]
* Column aliases can be used in the SELECT list of a SQL query in PostgreSQL.
* Like all objects, aliases will be in lowercase by default. If mixed-case letters or special symbols, or spaces are required, quotes must be used.
* Column aliases can be used for derived columns.
* Column aliases can be used with GROUP BY and ORDER BY clauses.
* We cannot use a column alias with WHERE and HAVING clauses.
