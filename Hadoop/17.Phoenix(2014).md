# Phoenix(2014)
> Apache Phoenix enables OLTP and operational analytics in Hadoop for low latency applications by combining the best of both worlds:
> the power of standard SQL and JDBC APIs with full ACID transaction capabilities and
> the flexibility of late-bound, schema-on-read capabilities from the NoSQL world by leveraging HBase as its backing store

> Apache Phoenix is fully integrated with other Hadoop products such as Spark, Hive, Pig, Flume, and Map Reduce.
