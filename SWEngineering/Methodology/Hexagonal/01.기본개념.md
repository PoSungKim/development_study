## Hexagonal Architecture
#### ChatGpt 3.0's Guidelines

<br>

### Ports and Adapters Architecture or Onion Architecture
* first introduced by Alistair Cockburn in the early 2000s
* decouple the core business logic of an application from the external systems, such as databases, user interfaces, or external APIs
  * decoupling is achieved through the use of "ports" and "adapters

<br>

### Ports + Adapters
* Port
  * interfaces or contracts for the application's core business logic
* Adapter
  * implementations that connect the ports to the external systems

<br>

### Shape
* The hexagonal shape is derived from the visual representation of the architecture, where the core business logic is placed in the center (hexagon), and the various adapters (representing the external systems) surround it

<br>

### Benefits
* Improved Testability
  * the core business logic is separated from external dependencies
* Flexibility and Maintainability
  * changes in external systems or technologies can be accommodated by modifying the adapters, leaving the core logic intact
* Clear Separation of Concerns
  * The architecture promotes a clear distinction between business logic and technical implementation details
* Loosely Coupled Components
  * The decoupling of core logic from external systems leads to a more modular and flexible application

<br>

### Consideration Before Adoption
* Hexagonal Architecture is particularly useful for complex applications or those that may undergo frequent changes in external integrations. However, it might add some initial complexity to the application, so its adoption should be considered based on the specific needs and requirements of the project

### Fundamental Blocks of the System

</div>

* User Interface
  * Various types of UI
* Business Logic (Application Core)
  * Actual Logic to run
* Infrastructure
  * a database, a search engine or 3rd party APIs

<br>

### Connecting the tools and delivery mechanisms to the Application Core

<div align="center">
 <img width="50%" src="https://github.com/PoSungKim/development_study/assets/37537227/33f90818-87a1-4de2-90e0-0ed17bc919fd" >
</div>

* Ports
  * interface with no knowledge of the concrete implementation that will actually be injected

<div align="center">
 <img width="50%" src="https://github.com/PoSungKim/development_study/assets/37537227/8da8c6b2-a421-49c5-8340-72897fc577cb" >
</div>
 
* Primary or Driving Adapters
  * both the port and its concrete implementation (the use case) belong inside the application
  * ex) controllers

<div align="center">
 <img width="50%" src="https://github.com/PoSungKim/development_study/assets/37537227/151af3b1-ae64-42e6-b28a-6350b5f8b92e" >
</div>

* Secondary or Driven Adapters
  * the port belongs inside the application, but its concrete implementation belongs outside and it wraps around some external tool
  * ex) repositories

<br>

### Inversion Of Control

<div align="center">
 <img width="50%" src="https://github.com/PoSungKim/development_study/assets/37537227/e987dba2-9599-4f48-814a-f70a2423976f" >
</div>

* this means the direction of dependencies is towards the centre, it’s the inversion of control principle at the architectural level
* our business logic only depends on the port (interface), so it doesn’t depend on a specific adapter or tool

## Application Core Organization
#### 

<br>

### Application Layer
* the Application Services and/or Command Handlers contain the logic to unfold a use case, a business process
* this layer also contains the triggering of Application Events, which represent some outcome of a use case

<br>

### Domain Layer
* the objects in this layer contain the data and the logic to manipulate that data, that is specific to the Domain itself
* it’s independent of the business processes that trigger that logic, they are independent and completely unaware of the Application Layer
* Domain Services
  * use a repository to find one or several entities
  * tell those entities to do some domain logic
  * and use the repository to persist the entities again, effectively saving the data changes
* Domain Model
  * Entities but also Value Objects, Enums and any objects used in the Domain Model

<br>
<hr>
<br>

## Components
#### Bounded Contexts (Package by Feature, Package by Component, Package by Layer)

<br>

<div align="center">
 <img width="50%" src="https://github.com/PoSungKim/development_study/assets/37537227/a5cf9d91-048d-42b6-84a3-3833ab950de0" >
</div>

<br>

### Decoupling the Components
* to decouple classes we make use of Dependency Injection, by injecting dependencies into a class as opposed to instantiating them inside the class

<br>

### Triggering Logic in Other Components
* Shared Kernel
  * this means that the components will both depend on the Shared Kernel but they will be decoupled from each other

<br>

### Getting Data from Other Components
* Data Storage Shared Between Components
  * must use the data that it does not “own” as read-only, by the means of queries
* Data Storage Segregated Per Component
  * each component will create a local copy of the data it needs from other components, to be used when needed
  * when the data changes in the component that owns it, that owner component will trigger a domain event carrying the data changes

## Flow of Control
#### 

<br>

### Pointing Inwards

<div align="center">

</div>

* the dependencies, that cross the border of the application core, they point inwards
  * a fundamental rule of Ports & Adapters Architecture, Onion Architecture and Clean Architecture
