## Hexagonal Architecture
#### ChatGpt 3.0's Guidelines

<br>

### Ports and Adapters Architecture or Onion Architecture
* first introduced by Alistair Cockburn in the early 2000s
* decouple the core business logic of an application from the external systems, such as databases, user interfaces, or external APIs
  * decoupling is achieved through the use of "ports" and "adapters

<br>

### Ports + Adapters
* Port
  * interfaces or contracts for the application's core business logic
* Adapter
  * implementations that connect the ports to the external systems

<br>

### Shape
* The hexagonal shape is derived from the visual representation of the architecture, where the core business logic is placed in the center (hexagon), and the various adapters (representing the external systems) surround it

<br>

### Benefits
* Improved Testability
  * the core business logic is separated from external dependencies
* Flexibility and Maintainability
  * changes in external systems or technologies can be accommodated by modifying the adapters, leaving the core logic intact
* Clear Separation of Concerns
  * The architecture promotes a clear distinction between business logic and technical implementation details
* Loosely Coupled Components
  * The decoupling of core logic from external systems leads to a more modular and flexible application

<br>

### Consideration Before Adoption
* Hexagonal Architecture is particularly useful for complex applications or those that may undergo frequent changes in external integrations. However, it might add some initial complexity to the application, so its adoption should be considered based on the specific needs and requirements of the project

* User Interface
  * Various types of UI
* Business Logic (Application Core)
  * Actual Logic to run
* Infrastructure
  * a database, a search engine or 3rd party APIs
