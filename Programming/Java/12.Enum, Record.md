## Enum

### [예시 - daysOfWeek]
```java
public class Main {
    public enum daysOfWeek{
        MONDAY("MON"), TUESDAY("TUES"), WEDNESDAY("WED");

        public final String shortName;

        daysOfWeek(String shortName) {
            this.shortName = shortName;
        }
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        System.out.println(daysOfWeek.TUESDAY);
        System.out.println(daysOfWeek.TUESDAY.shortName);
    }
}
```

## Record
#### [docs.oracle.com](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/14/language/records.html)

<br>

### A record acquires these members automatically
* A private final field for each of its components
* A public read accessor method for each component with the same name and type of the component; in this example, these methods are Rectangle::length() and Rectangle::width()
* A public constructor whose signature is derived from the record components list. The constructor initializes each private field from the corresponding argument.
* Implementations of the equals() and hashCode() methods, which specify that two records are equal if they are of the same type and their corresponding record components are equal
* An implementation of the toString() method that includes the string representation of all the record's components, with their names
